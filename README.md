![Harnessing Creativity and Innovation in the Workplace (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09049019-575a-4b6b-bf15-6f0c7998a493)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a multi-agent system that intelligently routes user queries to various data sources, including a vector store, Wikipedia, and Google Search. By leveraging powerful technologies such as LangChain, LangGraph, and HuggingFace embeddings, this application showcases how to build a responsive and intelligent AI system.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: For building LLM applications.
- **LangGraph**: A library for creating workflow graphs for LLM-based applications.
- **Cassio**: For integrating with Astra DB for storing vectors.
- **langchain_huggingface**: Provides HuggingFace embeddings for text processing.
- **langchain_community**: A community-contributed library for additional tools and integrations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Query Routing**: Routes questions to the most relevant data source based on their content.
- **Integration with Multiple Data Sources**: Supports retrieval from vector stores, Wikipedia, and Google Search.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Easily modify the workflow graph to add new data sources or change routing logic.
- **Embeddings for Semantic Search**: Utilizes HuggingFace embeddings for effective similarity-based searches.
